<h3>Evaluating what we have </h3>
<p> We now have a dataset with the following flags and measures:<br>
	- Sample restricted to those who were of working age and their monthly job level records when they were employed at least 15 hours 		
	when they were unemployed (we may want to drop these at this point for analyses) <br> 
	- Monthly level earnings from all sources in tpearn and and from their main job in tjb_msum
	- "*_status_f12" vars capture the *nth status held within the first 12 months (only non-missing for one observation) <br>
	- "status_*" vars capture the same information as the above vars but carryforward the value to be present for all observations <br> 
	- "months_s*" vars capture the number of consecutive months that a specific status was held during the first 12 months. For instance months_s1 = 6 and status_1 == 2 means the first 6 months we observed that individual they were self-employed. <br>
	- "last_status" is the last status held during the first 12 months we observe someone <br>
	- "mode_status_f12v1" is the most common that person held during the first 12 months and breaks ties by taking the min value (prioritizes employment)
	- "mode_status_f12v2" is the same as above, but takes the max mode so prioritizes unemployment in tie breaking <br>
	- pct_se_after_12 captures the share of months after the 12 month entry window that someone was self-employed. 
	So if someone is in our data for 36 months, we ignore the first 12 months, then count the number of months their main job 
	that they worked more than 15 hours was self-employment. That value is our numerator. Then we count the total number of months they 
	were present in the data post-12 month window (excluding the months they worked for fewer than 15 hours but including the months they were unemployed) <br>
<br>
We also have flags for unemployment during the first 12 months: <br>
	- months_unempf12 gives us the total number of months unemployed during first 12 months <br>
	- max_consec_unempf12 gives us the maximum consecutive spell of unemployment a person experienced <br>
	- unempf12_1, unempf12_3, unempf12_6 are flags indicating whether that person experienced at least 1, 3, or 6 months of consecutive unemployment 
	in the first 12 month window we observe them.
